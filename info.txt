Questions to optimize the code for you:

1. Data Source & Structure
   - Do you already have your bibliographic data? If so, what format is it in (CSV, Excel, RDS, database)?
   - What fields/columns does your dataset contain? (e.g., Title, Author, Year, Publisher, ISBN, Subject, Keywords, Abstract, etc.)
   - Approximately how many records do you have? (This helps determine if we need performance optimizations)

2. Filter Criteria
   - What specific filters do you want to include? For example:
     - Text search (Title, Author, Keywords)?
     - Year range?
     - Subject/Category dropdown?
     - Publisher?
     - Language?
     - Any other specific fields?

3. Display Preferences
   - Which columns should be visible in the results table?
   - Do you want any special formatting (e.g., clickable links, formatted citations)?
   - Should users be able to download the filtered results?

4. GitHub Hosting
   - Are you planning to deploy to shinyapps.io (free hosting for Shiny apps) or GitHub Pages? 
     - Note: GitHub Pages can't directly host Shiny apps since they require R to be running. You'd typically use shinyapps.io, Posit Connect, or your own server.
